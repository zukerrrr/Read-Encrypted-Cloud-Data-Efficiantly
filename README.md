# Read-Encrypted-Cloud-Data-Efficiantly

What This project is about??

Cloud computing is the computing technology that involves a large number of computers connected through a communication network such as internet, 
similar to utility computing and distributed computing. It has ability to run a program or application on many connected computers at the same time. 
Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) allows retrieval of encrypted data over cloud. Basically focus on addressing data privacy issues using searchable 
symmetric encryption (SSE). To eliminate the leakage, two-round searchable encryption (TRSE) scheme that supports top-k multi-keyword retrieval along 
with it propose a log file generation module. The efficiency of the system is enhanced by making retrieval of data in more secured and efficient manner. 
The vector space model helps to provide sufficient search accuracy, and the homomorphic encryption enables users to involve in the ranking while the 
majority of computing work is done on the server side by operations only on ciphertext. As a result, information leakage can be eliminated and data 
security is ensured. Thorough security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme guarantees high security and practical efficiency.
